### Virtual Environments
Virtual environments are used to seperate packages between python projects. This ensures that your project uses only the packages it needs and unneccesary packages will not be installed to the entire system. The 3 main virtual environment modules I know of are venv, virtualenv, and conda env

### virtualenv
Benefits:
1.  Allows user to specify the version of python they wish to use
    - Good for machine learning because the user can use python 3.6 and tensorflow
      - I believe tensorflow does not currently support python 3.8
