GDB is used for debugging C programs

Setup:
1) To Enable Debugging Compile With: gcc -g program.c

2) To Start Debugging: gdb ./a.out       **or whatever the exe name is**

3) run the program with the debugger attached with: run arg1 arg2... 

Breakpoints:
1) set break point with: b 18       ** 18 represents line number **

2) set conditional break points with: b 18 if i == 50 ** useful for big loop iterations,  MAKE SURE TO USE == NOT = **

3) set breakpoint of a function (works well if function is in seperate file): b function_name **whatever the function name is**

4) show all break points with: info break

5) delete break point with: del X       ** X represents the breakpoint number, breakpoint number found with 'info break'**

Show Variable Values:   
1) show variable value once with: print variableName

2) show variable value with each step: display variableName

3) step into a function with: s   

4) go to next line with: n

9) continue to next break point with: c

10) repeat previous command with: enter ** press the enter key, do not type enter **

11) restart debugger from the beginning with: r

12) quit the debugger with: q
