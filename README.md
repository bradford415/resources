# Coding Resources

Coding Resourcs contains useful information on programming resources that I have found useful throughout my computer engineering degree.

This repository contains information on debugging, text editors, algorithms and other resources that can be used a quick reference when coding 

Most of the information will be in PDF format containing pictures, this way it can be easily previewed through Github.

Currently, this repository is very incomplete but I plan on updating it throughtout my degree when I find helpful information to add.
